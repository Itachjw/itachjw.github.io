I am currently a Lecturer in the School of Computer Science of [Central China Normal University](https://english.ccnu.edu.cn/). I got my PhD from the School of Informatics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China, in 2022, supervised by Prof. Shaozi Li. I lead the Multimodal Affective Computing Group, which focuses on using  intellectual technologies to perceive, understand and express human emotions. In particular, I am interested in imbalance learning, weak label learning, information fusion. I am also interested in various machine learning applications in health care, bioinformatics, and human-computer interactio.
